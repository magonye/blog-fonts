My current read book is Clean Code, by Robert C. Martin. This is a MUST book, and it's some kind embarrassing I didn't read it before. 

I'm also attending the "[Learning how to learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/aprendiendo-a-aprender/home/welcome)" course at Coursera.

With the book, I'm trying to fix my fault, and with the course I'm trying to pave the road. If I want to learn a lot of things, I need to know how to become efficient.

These are all my readings in this month:
