I've started two new books: [Functional Programming, Simplified: (Scala edition)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36453393-functional-programming-simplified) and [Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change (The XP Series)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/67833.Extreme_Programming_Explained).

I read all these post and watched these videos during this month:

* [Microservices Architecture for eCommerce](http://go.divante.co/microservices-architecture-ecommerce/)
* [Valores y principios en el dise√±o del software - Fran Reyes #CAS2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXLCBcELu5Y)
* [Kotlin for Java Programmers by Venkat Subramaniam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EVXypZDOos)
