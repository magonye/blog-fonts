I've just created this blog for learning pourposes. I'm going to learn a lot of things. I think this blog can help me, but also some of my learnings can help someone else.

I hope you enjoy it as I'm going to enjoy it, and feel free to comment, suggest or  correct any of the content I will be posting here.

Remember that everything is about learning, enjoying, sharing and teaching. No matter  yours skills, the most important is the will of learn and teach.

Who am I? I'm Mike, a programmer that thought, some time ago, that he already knew everything that was needed to know to be a good programmer, but now, the only thing that I'm sure is that I have a long journey. A journey to learn to be a better professional. And that journey will never end!!
