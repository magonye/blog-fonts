It was a very challenging month!

We started a Community of Practice at my work. It's very exciting to share and learn things with other colleagues. We're doing some katas and lighting talks. It's only the beginning, but I think we can improve a lot with these meetings.

I'm also reading some books. I'm reading two of them (Sandro Mancuso's **The Software Craftsman** and **Growing Object Oriented Software**) with other people. It's very interesting to read a book with some other people. When talking about the book, you can see another point of view about the same chapters, and ask or share thoughts.

I also started the Intro to TDD by [J.BRains](http://www.jbrains.ca/).
