I've been working in an international company for more than two years, and I never did it before. Those are some of the things I've enjoyed the most:

DISCLAIMER: I know that some or all the points can be found in a national company, but I never did before. This post is based on my experience. I', not trying to say that all internation companies are better than national ones, or that you can live the same experience I did just by joining any random company.

# People from different nationalities
# Different company mindset
# Travel 
# English as company language
# Fairer salary

I hope you enjoyed the post. Let me know if you had similar expeciences. Or maybe totaly opposite.
