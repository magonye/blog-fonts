I finished **The Software Craftsman: Professionalism, Pragmatism, Pride** by [Sandro Mancuso](https://codurance.com/publications/author/sandro-mancuso/). It's an incredible book, very inspirational and plenty of good advices. I will review and publish it soon.

I read all these post and watched these videos during this month:
