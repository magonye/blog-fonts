This month I did the following things:

* **Book Club**: Actually reading **The Software Craftsman** by Sandro Mancuso, and **NonViolent Comunication** by Marshall B. Rosenberg.
* **Typing training**: I started doing some typing training at [typing.com](https://www.typing.com). There are other options, like [typingstudy.com](http://www.typingstudy.com), [typingclub.com](https://www.typingclub.com/)  or [cursomeca.com](https://www.cursomeca.com). I'll try them soon.
* **Software design patterns**: I started reviewing software design patterns at [sourcemaking.com](https://sourcemaking.com). This is something I need to improve, in order to know and understand them better.
* **Code Smells**: I'm studying code smells, with the help of Rachel, and also at [sourcemaking.com](https://sourcemaking.com). To know when something is wrong, is as important as to know when it's right. 
* **My blog**: This month I started publishing some posts on my blog. Now that I started, I have a lot of ideas for new posts. You'll see them soon published!!
