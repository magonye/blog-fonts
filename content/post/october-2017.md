This month I started a new book: [The Mythical Man-Month](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13629.The_Mythical_Man_Month), within a Book Club. 

I also stated watching the vide episodes by [Adrian Balboaca](https://twitter.com/adibolb) about [TDD as if you meant it](http://blog.adrianbolboaca.ro/evolutionary-design/).

Finally, I also added videos to my conferences videos, so, please, watch them and enjoy them as much as I did. You can find them [here](../categories/conferences-meetups/).
